# Ludum Dare 35 entry

Theme is _Shapeshift_.

I'll be using python and pygame.

## How to play

_WASD_ moves the player's polygon.

_↑↓_ changes the player's polygon (up increases number of sides, wraps around at the heptagon, down decreases, wraps at the triangle).

_←→_ changes the player's color (Red,Green,Blue,Yellow,Cyan,Magenta,Azure,Violet,Rose,Orange,Chartreuse,Spring Green)
